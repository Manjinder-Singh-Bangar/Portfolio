# Understanding JSON Web Tokens (JWT): From Basics to Intermediate

## Introduction
In modern web applications, authentication and authorization are crucial for securing user data and ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources. One of the most commonly used methods for authentication is JSON Web Token (JWT). JWT provides a compact, self-contained way to securely transmit information between parties.

This blog will guide you from the basics to intermediate-level concepts of JWT, including its structure, how it works, and best practices.

## What is a JWT?
A JSON Web Token (JWT) is a standardized, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting data as a JSON object. The data within a JWT is digitally signed, which ensures its integrity and authenticity.

JWTs are commonly used in authentication systems, allowing users to authenticate once and carry their credentials securely.

### **Why Use JWT?**
- **Stateless authentication** â€“ No need to store session data on the server.
- **Compact and URL-safe** â€“ Easily transmitted via HTTP headers or stored in cookies.
- **Secure** â€“ Uses cryptographic signatures to verify authenticity.
- **Decentralized** â€“ No need to contact a central authentication server after issuance.

## JWT Structure
A JWT consists of three parts, each separated by a dot (`.`):

```
Header.Payload.Signature
```

### **1. Header**
The header typically contains two parts:
- The type of the token (`JWT`).
- The signing algorithm (e.g., `HS256` for HMAC-SHA256).

Example:
```json
{
  "alg": "HS256",
  "typ": "JWT"
}
```

This header is then **Base64Url encoded**.

---

### **2. Payload**
The payload contains the claims, which are statements about the user or additional metadata. There are three types of claims:
1. **Registered claims** â€“ Predefined claims like `iss` (issuer), `exp` (expiration time), `sub` (subject), etc.
2. **Public claims** â€“ Custom claims that can be used across different applications.
3. **Private claims** â€“ Custom claims that are shared between specific parties.

Example:
```json
{
  "sub": "1234567890",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "admin": true,
  "exp": 1718000000
}
```

This payload is also **Base64Url encoded**.

---

### **3. Signature**
The signature is used to verify that the JWT has not been altered. It is created by encoding the header and payload using a secret key or a public/private key pair.

For HMAC-SHA256:
```
HMACSHA256(
  base64UrlEncode(header) + "." + base64UrlEncode(payload),
  secret
)
```

This ensures that the token has not been tampered with.

## How JWT Authentication Works
1. **User Logs In:**
   - The user provides credentials (e.g., email and password) to an authentication server.
   - If credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and sends it to the user.

2. **Client Stores the Token:**
   - The JWT is stored in local storage, session storage, or a cookie.

3. **Client Makes Requests:**
   - The client includes the JWT in the `Authorization` header of each request:
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <JWT>
   ```

4. **Server Verifies JWT:**
   - The server extracts the JWT and verifies the signature.
   - If valid, it processes the request; otherwise, it rejects it.

5. **Token Expiration & Refresh:**
   - Tokens often include an expiration (`exp`) claim.
   - A refresh token mechanism can be implemented to issue new tokens when the old one expires.

## Implementing JWT in Node.js (Intermediate Level)

### **1. Installing Dependencies**
First, install the required dependencies:
```
npm install jsonwebtoken express dotenv
```

### **2. Creating and Signing a Token**
```javascript
const jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');
const secretKey = "your_secret_key";

function generateToken(user) {
  return jwt.sign(
    { id: user.id, name: user.name },
    secretKey,
    { expiresIn: "1h" }
  );
}
```

### **3. Verifying a Token**
```javascript
function verifyToken(token) {
  try {
    return jwt.verify(token, secretKey);
  } catch (err) {
    return null;
  }
}
```

### **4. Middleware for Authentication**
```javascript
function authMiddleware(req, res, next) {
  const token = req.headers.authorization?.split(" ")[1];
  if (!token) return res.status(401).json({ message: "Unauthorized" });

  const decoded = verifyToken(token);
  if (!decoded) return res.status(403).json({ message: "Invalid token" });

  req.user = decoded;
  next();
}
```

## Best Practices for Using JWT
âœ… **Use Secure Signing Algorithms:** Prefer RS256 (asymmetric) over HS256 (symmetric) for better security.

âœ… **Set Expiry for Tokens:** Always set an `exp` claim to prevent indefinite token usage.

âœ… **Use Refresh Tokens:** Short-lived access tokens + long-lived refresh tokens ensure better security.

âœ… **Store Tokens Securely:**
   - **Local Storage** â€“ Avoid storing tokens here if possible (vulnerable to XSS).
   - **Cookies** â€“ Use HTTP-only cookies for added security.

âœ… **Validate Tokens Properly:** Ensure tokens are verified on the backend before processing requests.

âœ… **Revoke Tokens When Needed:** Implement mechanisms to invalidate compromised or expired tokens.
